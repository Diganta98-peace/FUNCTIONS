    "On the other hand, a method is also a function, but it is associated with an object and is defined within a class. \n",
    "Methods are called on objects (instances of classes) and automatically take the object itself as the first parameter, \n",

    "where `person` is an instance of the class.\n",

    "The concept of function arguments and parameters is essential for how functions receive and process data. \n",
    "Parameters are the variable names used when defining a function; they act as placeholders for the values that the \n",
    "function will use when it is called. For example, in the function definition def add(a, b):, the variables a and b are parameters.\n",
    "These parameters do not hold any actual value until the function is called.\n",
    "Arguments, on the other hand, are the real values that are passed into the function during a function call. \n",
    "For instance, in the statement add(5, 3), the numbers 5 and 3 are the arguments that get assigned to the parameters a and b respectively. \n",
    "Python functions can accept different types of arguments to provide flexibility in how they are used.\n",
    "There are several types of arguments in Python. Positional arguments are the most common and are matched to parameters \n",
    "based on their position in the function call. Keyword arguments are specified by explicitly stating the name of the parameter, \n",
    "such as add(a=5, b=3), which allows arguments to be passed in any order. Default arguments are parameters that have a predefined \n",
    "value in the function definition, allowing the function to be called with fewer arguments. For example, def greet(name=\"Guest\"): lets the \n",
    "function work even if no value is passed for name. Python also supports variable-length arguments using *args for multiple positional arguments \n",
    "and **kwargs for multiple keyword arguments. These features make Python functions highly flexible and adaptable to various programming needs.\n",
